    <h5>        1. whether women's rights have been enshrined in the Bill of Rights up?<br>
2.If the answer is yes, are there any specific measures to implement these rights?<br>
 3.Many women's issues are considered "household matters," are they therefore excluded from the enshrined judicial rights?</h5>

<h1>People often think that human rights cover women's rights, but this is not the case.<br>
 Because of women's reproductive capacity, they have specific needs for rights that are often considered too specific to be included in human rights legislation and are often ignored or omitted.
 On the other hand, since women are adults, all human rights legislatures assume that they already include all the rights women need.
 Moderate feminists insist that gender-blind legislation has dangerous consequences for women.<br>
 In the early stages of the feminist movement, there was a profound question:<br>
 Do women want to be seen like men, or do they want to be seen as one of two different genders where the differences between the two are respected by all?<br>
 The danger here is that:
 If women are the same as men, what is the problem with women?
 They just need to work harder than men and break down invisible career barriers.
 On the other hand, if women insist that they are different from men, they are seen as deviant from the 'standard' or the norm - which is set by the men - and in this perspective, women are defined as inferior.
