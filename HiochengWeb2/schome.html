Women perform 75% of unpaid care work in the home and contribute $10 trillion a year to global GDP, yet are taken for granted.  First, in a dual-career family, both are migrant workers, and women have to take on housework and take care of the whole family after work.  After having children, more women will also choose to become full-time housewives due to the increase in housework, which directly leads to women being poorer than men.  "Carrying a baby is much more tiring than going to work", which will always resonate in the Chinese honey circle.  There is always a queue in front of the women's bathroom, and the men's bathroom is unimpeded.  Because of the different physiological structure of women, the time to go to the toilet is 2.3 times that of men, and they usually spend time taking care of the elderly and children, while the men's bathroom will add urinals to accommodate more men.  Even so, women's needs have never been considered, and the area of men's and women's bathrooms in public places is still designed to be exactly the same.  In almost all job categories, there is a six to seven standard difference in pay between men and women.
There is a huge gap in the pay of male and female actors in the film and television industry, and men can have more role opportunities and appearance time.  In ordinary workplaces, men will get more jobs and promotion opportunities than women, and it will be more difficult for women of childbearing age to find jobs.
 There are too many examples like this, and the cruel facts are placed in front of each of us. Don't say "men and women are much more equal now" and don't say "everyone is like this".  <br>The solution is actually quite simple:
 Please stop ignoring women, ask women, what do they need?
